## Development

### Dependencies

1. Install Rust using [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/index.html) is a command line utility that is part of the Rust toolchain that can be used to install additional tools.

### Process

1. Select an issue to work on, and inform the maintainers.
2. Fork the project.
3. `git clone` the forked version of the project.
4. Work on the `main` branch for smaller patches and a separate branch for new features
5. After writing some code, run -
   - `cargo fmt`
   - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo test`
6. If all tests are passing, pull changes from the original remote with a rebase, and push the changes to your remote repository.
7. Use the GitHub website to create a Pull Request and wait for the maintainers to review it.
